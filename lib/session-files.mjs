/**
 * Which files this session has touched, by repository.
 *
 * This exists to answer one question honestly: **when a turn ends, which
 * repositories are this session's to commit?**
 *
 * There are two bad answers, and one of them is bad in a way that is easy to
 * miss.
 *
 * Answer one: "the repository the session's working directory is in". Wrong
 * whenever the workspace root is not itself a repository — the layout here —
 * because a session that edited `dsh-foo/src/x.mjs` then looks like it touched
 * nothing at all.
 *
 * Answer two: "every repository under the working directory with a dirty tree".
 * This is what the automatic turn sync originally did, and it is right for one
 * session working alone. It is actively wrong once several sessions share a
 * checkout: an Agent Team's teammates are separate sessions dirtying the same
 * filesystem, so this answer commits **their** work in progress under **this**
 * session's turn number. Nothing is lost, but the attribution is scrambled and
 * the commits are not the ones anybody asked for.
 *
 * So the session keeps its own list, keyed by repository. Every mutating file
 * operation the tools layer dispatches is recorded through the same interception
 * point the shipped `@deepseek-ai/dsh-workspace-changes` recorder uses, and a
 * turn end commits only what appears in it. Another session's edits are
 * reported, never committed.
 *
 * The store is a plain one-line-per-record file rather than memory, because a
 * Host restart mid-task must not lose the fact that work is uncommitted. Rows
 * are `{repoRoot, path}`, both absolute; the newest row wins.
 *
 * Only `node:` builtins are imported, and every function is fail-soft: an
 * unusable store costs precision, never the process.
