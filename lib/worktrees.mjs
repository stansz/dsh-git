/**
 * dsh-git — one git worktree per task, with an owner.
 *
 * Two agents editing one checkout fight over the index: one stages the other's
 * half-finished file, and a `git status` that was clean a moment ago is not.
 * A linked worktree per task is the fix — its own HEAD, its own index, shared
 * history — but worktrees carry three traps of their own, and this module exists
 * to close them.
 *
 * The first is path identity. `git worktree list` reports realpaths, so on
 * macOS a worktree created under `/tmp` comes back as `/private/tmp`. A caller
 * comparing its own string against the list sees "no such worktree" for the one
 * that is right there, and then creates a second one or refuses to clean up.
 * Every comparison here goes through `sameFsPath`, which realpaths both sides.
 *
 * The second is deletion. `git worktree remove` refuses a dirty worktree for
 * good reason, and the naive fix — `--force`, or `rm -rf` — destroys work with
 * no error to notice. This module never forces on its own: a refusal comes back
 * as `ok:false` with the dirty paths named, and the caller decides.
 *
 * The third is ownership, which is why a small marker file is written next to
 * the worktree rather than inside it. Inside, it would show up as an untracked
 * file in every `git status` and could be committed by accident; outside, at
 * `<worktreeRoot>/<repo>/<slug>.owned.json`, it is invisible to git and still
 * answers "did dsh-git make this, or is it somebody's work?" before anything is
 * pruned.
 *
 * Only `node:` builtins are imported, and only relative imports reach the rest
 * of the bundle, so this file works wherever the bundle is installed.
